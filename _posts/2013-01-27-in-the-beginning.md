I have long avoided the world of blogging, along with most forms of social networking. I have never wished to contribute to the epidemic of over-sharing on today's internet. Recently, however, I have begun to think differently. As a developer, I have been helped many times by the blogs of other developers. My quest for an elusive solution to a nagging technical problem has often been paved by the experiences of others. As a professional programmer, very little (if any) of what I do is unbroken ground. This, there is much that can be gleaned from the experiences of others. While [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) remains my go-to resource, developer blogs have proven to be excellent resources as well.

I debated with myself for some time before deciding to start this blog. Ultimately, it boiled down to 3 questions. As a means of documenting the purpose of this blog, I will answer them here.

# What would I blog about?
As I mentioned above, I have no interest in airing out my life for all the world to see, nor do I think anyone out there cares enough to read it. Thus, my blog must be almost exclusively professional. I expect that I will not be able to resist all temptations to bloviate, but I decided to focus on these areas:

*   Coding - solving problems, learning new APIs and frameworks
*   Development - my journey to becoming a better developer
*   Technology - dealing with the technology in our lives and work

# What are my expectations?
I have no delusions of grandeur. I am not Scott Hanselman, and I doubt that anyone will even read this little blog of mine. I am perfectly fine with that. Which brings me to my next question...

# Why bother?
This was the more difficult question to answer. I'm no writer, so why should I take the time to run a blog? Ultimately, I feel that this old adage sums it up best: "If you want to learn something, teach it to someone else." My hope is that taking the time to collect my thoughts and organize them into writing will help commit them to memory and understanding. Although, should some developer find my experiences helpful, then all the better.

And so I begin my journey with a beer in hand and a soundtrack provided by Nirvana.
