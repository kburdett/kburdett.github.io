<p>
    Welcome to my homepage! My own little corner of the internet. I put this site here for three reasons.

<ol>
    <li>I own the domain, so I figure I should put something here&hellip;</li>
    <li>I think having an internet presence under my control is important (basically, anything <em>not</em> social
        media).
    </li>
    <li>I wanted a technology proving grounds to experiment with stuff</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1>The Technology</h1>
<p>
    I like finding new technologies to play with, and fun ways to incorporate them into this site. I only use <abbr
        title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> when building this site, which is itself open-source.
    Currently, the technologies are changing more frequently than the content. Here is the current state of the
    website.
</p>

<h2>
    <div class="jekyll-logo">
        <img src="assets/jekyll.png" width="130" height="60" alt="Jekyll Logo">
    </div>
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a blog-aware static file generator for web pages. Previously,
    I was using an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> based site. I love AngularJS, but applying it
    to my site was like driving a roofing nail with a sledge hammer. All of my content is static, so I was
    really only using Angular's templating capabilities. In addition, I'm using static file hosting only. This
    means I cannot run code on the server, preventing pre-rendering for crawlers like Google. I started
    searching out more appropriate alternatives and came across Jekyll. I chose it for several few reasons.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Free and open-source software (a requirement for me here...)</li>
    <li>Dead simple, I had a template site up and running in a few minutes</li>
    <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">Supported natively on
        GitHub pages</a></li>
    <li>Strong community with good plugin support</li>
    <li>Supports pages in multiple formats, but most the important to me is Markdown (helps keep my blog
        portable)
    </li>
    <li>Transparent, Ruby runs on the server and the client never has to know it is there</li>
</ul>

<h2>Foundation</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> is a responsive front-end framework. I was growing tired of <a
        href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> from my previous page and looking for alternatives. Foundation was
    an easy grab. The framework is mature, semantic and (most importantly) <em>un-opinionated</em>. I was impressed by
    how well their classes have been arranged. You only need one or two classes to get the functionality you need. The
    SASS mixins are excellent, adding a whole new level of flexibility. I'm no designer, but I really appreciate how
    simple customization of the styling is as well. The Foundation guys have done an impressive job providing an
    excellent framework while staying out of your way.
</p>

<h2>
    <img id="logo-sass" src="assets/sass.svg" width="130" height="98" alt="SASS" title="SASS">
</h2>
<p>
    SASS is short for <a href="https://sass-lang.com">Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets</a>. A name that pretty
    much says it all! I have some experience with LESS, both on my previous site and professionally, so the concept
    of SASS was not new to me. It is a great fit for this site due to its strong ties to both Foundation and Jekyll.
    My CSS needs for this website are minimal at best, so I really haven't put it to the test. Still, I found SASS
    to be very helpful. Especially with regards to Foundation. By compiling Foundation from SASS rather than pulling
    the CSS directly, you get a highly customizable framework without any override CSS files. Just change out the
    SASS variables to suit your needs and you are done!

<h2>
    <img id="logo-markdown" src="assets/markdown-mark.svg" width="130" alt="Markdown" title="Markdown">
    Markdown
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a plaintext formatting syntax. It has
    gained wide adoption in the technology community due to its natural conversion to HTML. The intent is for the
    text to be readable, as is, without all of the markup required for an HTML document. The result is a very
    intuitive language that is easy to type, read, and process. Markdown support has been added to a number of tools
    as it spreads across the internet. I find it less intrusive during composition, so I spend less time closing my
    tags and more time writing my content. As a bonus, this keeps the content portable between content management
    systems.
