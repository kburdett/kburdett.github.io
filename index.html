<h1>Welcome</h1>
<div>
    Welcome to my homepage! My own little corner of the internet. I put this site here for three reasons.
    <ol>
        <li>I own the domain, so I figure I should put something here&hellip;</li>
        <li>I think having an internet presence under my control is important (basically, anything <em>not</em> social
            media).
        </li>
        <li>I wanted a technology proving grounds to experiment with stuff</li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Stack</h1>
<div>
    I like finding new technologies to play with, and fun ways to incorporate them into this site. I only use <abbr
        title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> when building this site, which is itself open-source.
    Currently, the technologies are changing more frequently than the content. Here is the current state of the website.

<h2>Jekyll</h2>
<div class="media-object stack-for-small">
    <div class="media-object-section">
        TODO
    </div>
    <div class="media-object-section">
        Jekyll logo here
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Foundation</h2>
<div class="media-object stack-for-small">
