        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h4>Bio</h4>

        <p>I am software developer living in Atlanta, GA. I have 7 years of experience in the software industry,
            specializing in C#.NET development. I am a certified SCRUM master, and a firm believer in the power of
            Agile. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about
            continued learning and growth in both my personal and professional lives. I have a love of all things
            motorized, but motorcycles will always be my favorite!</p>

        <br>
        <h4>History</h4>

        <p>I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2008. After graduating, I accepted a position with Client Profiles as a
            junior developer. I had been working as a part time developer with Client Profiles for almost 3 years. I
            specialized in Microsoft Exchange Server integration, developing in C#.NET. I also dealt with a lot of
            process improvement surrounding build and deployment, developer support, and source control management. I
            stayed on full time at Client Profiles until late 2011, when the company underwent a difficult acquisition.
            In December of that year, I accepted a senior software development position with RMI (now GE
            Transportation), where I began life as a web developer specializing in ASP.NET MVC. I became a certified
            SCRUM master and became immersed in the Agile development process. I was later promoted to the development
            lead for the project. I am still employed there today, leading a team of 8. My team is working on new
            product development mixed with custom project work in an ASP.NET MVC4 environment.</p>

                <h4>Project Euler</h4>
                Project Euler presents a series of programming challenges, largely math-based, for users to solve. Since
                the majority of my work consists of planning and design, it is refreshing to do some good old fashioned
                programming :) Most of the Project Euler problems require little or no design, so I get to spend some
                time devoted solely to the crafting and optimization of targeted algorithms. I really enjoy working on
                micro-optimizations and algorithmic improvements. It is a nice change of pace from designing complicated
                data structures and reviewing customer requirements.

                <h4>GitHub</h4>
                GitHub is the modern home for open source software. Having worked with Git as a source control provider
                for a while now, I am a huge fan. GitHub provides free hosting to any project, as long as it is public.
                I don't have much here (currently) but I am trying to get more involved with the open source community.
                For now, this badge will merely serve as motivation.

        </div>
        <p>In February of 2013, I adopted my Greyhound, Aiken. As with most decisions in my life, I began my dog search
            with Google. A search for good apartment dogs led me to Greyhounds. This surprised me at first. I always
            assumed they were high energy dogs. They are bred for running, after all. In truth, Greyhounds are bred for
            <em>sprinting</em>, which is an important distinction. They are prone to short bursts of energy followed by
            hours (many hours...) of lounging. I was looking for a dog that was quiet, low maintenance, and gentle.
            Greyhounds seemed to fit the bill nicely, so I thought it worth meeting some. I headed over to <a
                    href="http://www.greyhounds2.org/">Adopt a Greyhound Atlanta</a> to meet some. I fell in love with
            the breed immediately. It is impossible to resist their gentle nature and those big, expressive eyes. I met
            a few, but Aiken took to one another quickly. He was just what I was looking for, so I took him home. Having
            a dog around has been quite a change for me. He has adjusted to being a house pet pretty quickly, much more
            quickly than I have adjusted to having one. The experience has been very demanding, but very rewarding!</p>

        <p>If you are thinking of adopting a dog, I would encourage you to head over to <a
                href="http://www.greyhounds2.org/">Adopt a Greyhound Atlanta</a> and meet some Greyhounds. They are such
            a special breed!</p>
