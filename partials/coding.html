<p>So what am I up to? I can't share my work, but I can share my hobbies! Here's a little about the things I code</p>

    <h3>Project Euler</h3>

        Project Euler presents a series of programming challenges, largely math-based, for users to solve. Since the
        majority of my work consists of planning and design, it is refreshing to do some good old fashioned programming
        :) Most of the Project Euler problems require little or no architecture, so I get to spend some time devoted
        solely to the crafting and optimization of targeted algorithms. I really enjoy working on micro-optimizations
        and algorithmic improvements. It is a nice change of pace from designing complicated data structures and
        reviewing customer requirements.

    <h3>GitHub</h3>

        GitHub is the modern home for open source software. Having worked with Git as a source control provider for a
        while now, I am a huge fan. GitHub provides free hosting to any project (including this page), as long as it is
        public. I don't have much here (currently) but I am trying to get more involved with the open source community.
        There are so many open source projects out there, it is difficult finding a place to start. In the mean time, I
        am publishing some of my own code. Who knows, maybe somebody will find it useful...
