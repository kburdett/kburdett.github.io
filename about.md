# Bio

I am software developer living in Atlanta, GA. I have 7 years of experience in the software industry, specializing in C#.NET development. I am a certified SCRUM master, and a firm believer in the power of Agile. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about continued learning and growth in both my personal and professional lives. I have a love of all things motorized, but motorcycles will always be my favorite!

# History

I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2008. After graduating, I accepted a position with Client Profiles as a junior developer. I had been working as a part time developer with Client Profiles for almost 3 years. I specialized in Microsoft Exchange Server integration, developing in C#.NET. I also dealt with a lot of process improvement surrounding build and deployment, developer support, and source control management. I stayed on full time at Client Profiles until late 2011, when the company underwent a difficult acquisition. In December of that year, I accepted a senior software development position with RMI (now GE Transportation), where I began life as a web developer specializing in ASP.NET MVC. I became a certified SCRUM master and became immersed in the Agile development process. I was later promoted to the development lead for the project. I am still employed there today, leading a team of 7. My team is working on new product development mixed with custom project work in an ASP.NET MVC4 environment.
