# The Purpose

I created this page for three reasons:

1. I own the domain, so I figure I should put something here...
1. I think having an internet presence under my control is important (read: not social media).
1. I wanted a "sandbox" for playing with fun web technologies that intrigue me.


# The Stack

Though the content may not change much, the technology behind this site is constantly in flux. I am always finding new things to play with, and fun ways to incorporate them into this site. I thought I would take a moment to talk about the technologies in use. All of them are open source, and all of them are awesome.

# [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

jQuery is a JavaScript library for DOM manipulation, Ajax queries, and numerous other things. I'm not sure you can even create a modern web page without jQuery...


# The Source

This page is open source, and available on GitHub. You can view/download/clone/fork the source from [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/kburdett/kburdett.github.io).
